Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

You should check codes online for controlling drones with djitellopy library

Before you execute any code always connect to the drone first 
Here is how, tello.connect()
tello.connect() - conneccts to the drone

tello.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
Important to note is that when you takeoff, the minimum you can fly is 20 centimeters
tello.move_left(100) 
tello.rotate_clockwise(90)
tello.move_forward(100)

tello.land() - lands the drone.

tello = Tello()


keepRecording = True
tello.streamon()
frame_read = tello.get_frame_read()


# we need to run the recorder in a seperate thread, otherwise blocking options
#  would prevent frames from getting added to the video
recorder = Thread(target=videoRecorder)
recorder.start()

tello.move_up(100) - takes off and move the drone up by 100 centimeters
 """Fly x cm up.
        Arguments:
            x: 20-500
        """ - the minimum you can fly is 20 centimeters and maximum is 500 centimeters
tello.rotate_counter_clockwise(360)
tello.land() - to land the drone

tello.streamon()
frame_read = tello.get_frame_read()

tello.takeoff()
cv2.imwrite("picture.png", frame_read.frame)

A few useful things: 

If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
